ETL Pipeline for Financial Market Data

Overview

This project implements an ETL pipeline that extracts financial market data from various sources, transforms the data as needed, and loads it into an AWS S3 bucket for further analysis or storage.

Features:
Data Extraction: Pulls real-time financial data from APIs such as Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, or similar sources.
Data Transformation: The extracted data is cleaned, filtered, and transformed using Python and Pandas.
Data Loading: The cleaned data is uploaded to an S3 bucket for further processing or use in data analysis tools like Athena or QuickSight.
Requirements

Before you can run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Pandas: For data manipulation
Boto3: AWS SDK for Python to interact with AWS services
Requests: For API calls
AWS CLI: To configure your AWS credentials and interact with S3
To install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup Instructions

1. AWS Credentials
Before running the project, you need to set up your AWS credentials. The pipeline will interact with AWS S3, so ensure that your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are properly configured.

You can configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI:

bash
Copy code
aws configure
This will store your credentials in ~/.aws/credentials.

2. Configure the S3 Bucket
Make sure you have an S3 bucket created to store the processed data. Update the S3_BUCKET_NAME in the script to point to your bucket.

How to Run the ETL Pipeline

To run the pipeline, execute the main script etl_pipeline.py:

bash
Copy code
python etl_pipeline.py
This will:

Fetch financial data from the API.
Transform the data (e.g., clean up, filter, format).
Upload the processed data to your S3 bucket.
Security Considerations

While this project demonstrates an ETL pipeline, it's important to handle sensitive data (such as AWS credentials) properly:

1. Do Not Hardcode Credentials
For security reasons, never hardcode your AWS credentials directly into your code. Instead:

Use environment variables to store your credentials securely.
Alternatively, use the AWS CLI (aws configure) or IAM roles (for EC2 or Lambda).
2. Rotate AWS Keys Regularly
If you suspect that your AWS credentials have been exposed, rotate (regenerate) them immediately:

Go to IAM > Users > Security credentials and delete the compromised keys.
3. GitHub Secret Scanning
If youâ€™re working on a GitHub repository, make sure to enable Secret Scanning to prevent pushing sensitive data like AWS keys accidentally. GitHub will automatically scan for exposed secrets and block the push.
